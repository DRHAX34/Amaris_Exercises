## Things to Improve

There are definitely things that need to improve in this exercise, mainly the following:

1. Exercise 1 and 2 loading (Since the other candidates didn't finish before the deadline and have been given more time (and subsequently, more time for me as well), I have fixed this)

2. Exercise 3 Edit Text remove focus:
  * On Emulator, it removes focus correcly, on some phones it does not. I do not know of a way to prevent this for now (will keep searching)

## Things missing

1. Exercise 2 Toolbar becoming transparent/opaque when scrolling up/down (Has been added and is now working!)

Well, as they all say:

> There is never enough available time for doing all the things we want, but we do have to make the most of the time we have.

## Detected bugs
1. Exercise 1 caching seems to run two times (This has been fixed)
